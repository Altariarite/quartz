[Philip Wadler](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/). [Propositions as Types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU&ab_channel=StrangeLoopConference). Is math and programming languages invented, or discovered?

[Ian Henry](https://ianthehenry.com/) . His article on [Fibonacci Matrix](https://ianthehenry.com/posts/fibonacci/) is amazing. When you think about the Fibonacci sequence do you think of a swirling vortex of points? You should! Lots of other good and fun stuffs as well. 

[thi.ng](https://thi.ng/). I am going through his workshops on clojure and visualization and I learned a lot

[[Charlie Munger]]. I wrote a note about his "latticework of models" [[查理芒格的思维格栅]] and it's one of my favourites. It is a life-long learning process.

[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/).  His digital garden is the inspiration of this digital garden. And [How to write good prompts](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/) is a magic spell to learning anything.

Just listing names I could think of but doesn't mean they are less important! I am going to keep updating the page:


Ursula K. Le Guin

Jean Micheal Jarre

Sato Naoki

8-bit music theory
