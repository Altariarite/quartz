title: "Don't quit your shows"

You can't plan on anything, you can only go about your work, as Isak Dinesen wrote, "every day, without hope or despair." You can't count on success; you can only leave open the possibility for it, and be ready to jump on and take the ride when it comes for you.

I applied this principle to [[Keep coding]] a clojure app and it worked wonders.

[[Show your work!]]
