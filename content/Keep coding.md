title: "Keep coding"

Stop in the middle of a sentence - [[Chain Smoke]]

In the coding equivalent, I simply left TODO comments and marked DONE ones, so when I come back and see my TODO I can immediately start working on the next one. 

This lets me stick on to a project and immediately know where to start.

```clojure
;; DONE: align tick to the left
;; DONE: remove ticks + append table below to show year
;; DONE: format table to have same sized cell
;; DONE: reformat to include 15 years of prices
;; DONE: add hi-lo table
;; TODO: get monthly data from somewhere
;; TODO: display 12 months data in a single colomn
```
