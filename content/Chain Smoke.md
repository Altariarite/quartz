A successful or failed project is no guarantee of another success of failure.

If you look to artists who've managed to achieve lifelong careers, you detect that same pattern: They all have been able to persevere, regardless of success or failure. Singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell said that whatever she felt was the weak link in her last project gave her inspiration for the next. Bob Pollard, the lead singer and songwriter for Guided by Voices, says he never gets writer's block because he never stops writing. Author Ernest Hemingway would stop in the middle of a sentence at the end of his day's work so he knew where to start in the morning.
